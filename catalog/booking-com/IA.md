# Booking.com — Information Architecture

## Overview

Booking.com is the world's largest online travel agency (OTA), listing 28M+ properties across hotels, apartments, hostels, villas, and unique stays. The mental model is **search → compare → book → stay** with an emphasis on **urgency and social proof**. The interface is famously data-dense, using psychological nudges ("Only 2 rooms left!", "12 people looking at this right now", "Free cancellation") to drive conversions. Booking.com's IA is optimized for hotel booking first, with flights, car rentals, and attractions as secondary offerings.
