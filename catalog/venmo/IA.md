# Information Architecture — Venmo

## Overview
Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment service owned by PayPal, distinguished by its **social feed** that turns transactions into a social experience. The IA supports sending/receiving money, a social timeline, the Venmo Debit Card, business profiles, and crypto trading. The web presence serves primarily as marketing and account management; the core experience lives in the mobile app.
